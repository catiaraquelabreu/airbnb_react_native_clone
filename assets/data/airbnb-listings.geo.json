We are a quiet, secure gated community with about 35 spread out homes. Our neighbors keep to themselves, though you might run into them if you take a walk! You cannot see other properties from our house (and they can't see you). We are one of the most removed/private houses in the neighborhood. WILDLIFE/NATURE  This beautiful, diverse, and wild mountain is home to an amazing assortment of wildlife. This is THEIR home we are their neighbors on the edge of this wilderness.

Malibu is especially beautiful in the late winter and early spring, known for its very low tides and spectacular sunsets.  The later Spring months are lovely, too.... less crowded on the beaches (especially Zuma Beach), but warmer weather.  Summer is the classic Malibu experience:sun, sand and endless fun boogie boarding, paddling and surfing.  Of course, the local kids are in the ocean 365 days a year, with or without wetsuits! We live in a fire zone, and safety is paramount for all: your space has a kitchenette, but not a full kitchen with an oven.  We do have a hotplate for you to use if you'd like, a microwave oven, a coffee maker, a 3/4 sized refrigerator, a kitchen sink and a fully equipped kitchenette with tableware, cups, mugs and service for 4.  We have a dining area and lots of take-out places really close by for hot food and such.",

Our skies are dark at night, and our neighbors tend to be environmentally minded, ocean lovers who deeply appreciate Malibu's pristine environment, especially at this end of town (see map, we are deep into Malibu, a mile from Zuma Beach).  :-)a",
        "notes": "Remember you are in Malibu, so bring things to help you enjoy the beach and/or hiking.  Also, remember that you are in a rural neighborhood, so you'll need a car or experience ind using Uber to get around.... Malibu is many miles long and there are many cool neighborhoods, beaches and local spots that you may wish to see during your time here in Paradise!",
        "transit": "No public transportation is available except one bus line that goes into and out of Santa Monica..... UBER works as it does in many more rural towns/environments.... and of course rental cars are recommended, as Malibu has much to see and do.  We have a dedicated parking spot for you, so you won't have to park on the street, but there is not a garage, so your car will be exposed to the elements!  Not a problem for us, but don't bring your pristine auto with a new paint job unless you don't mind a bit of dust, salty ocean air, leaves, and the occasional remnant left by low-flying sea gulls!",
        "access": "You can access the entire guest cottage and its adjacent private patio, and we will respect your privacy always.  When you arrive, please park in your designated parking spot, which is located immediately adjacent to the address posted for the house: 5765 Busch Drive.   We will meet you outside where the parking spot is located and walk you in if you give us a \"heads up\" when you are a few minutes out!   If you arrive late or need to get in and we have not greeted you yet, here are the instructions for getting in: There is a walkthrough gate right there next to the brass bell, and you can enter the property there.  Walk through the gate toward the BACK of the property: there are two bungalows to your RIGHT.  Your bungalow is the one all the way to the back, on the right, with the RED DOOR.  Enter via the gate that has a sign on it that says: MERMAIDS WELCOME. And YOU are welcome, too! Jennie and Carol",

There is always someone home to assist you with arrival and departure, and to answer any questions you might have about how to spend your leisure time in our beautiful neighborhood that includes close-by Zuma Beach and the Santa Monica Mountains trailhead for spectacular ocean view hiking.  We appreciate our guests respecting the quiet of our neighborhood, the dark night skies, and the pristine beaches of Lechusa and Broad Beach, easily accessible and  five minute drive from our home.",

Our guest home is also circa 1950, and we love to share it with travelers who appreciate a more rustic (yet very charming) space.... take a look at the pictures, which will give you a feel for our home and property!  The beach is five minutes away, and we have an ocean view from the front of our property (though not from the guest house).

Once I send you the directions please actually read them before you get into your car because the Corral Canyon part of your drive does not work too well with GPS or WAZE. And I promise you will get lost.  Another consideration is that once we agree on an arrival window of time to please honor that as this is not the kind of Estate where we can leave out a key in a lockbox.  We need to check you in personally, so if we agree you're arriving between 4 and 5 pm can you please do that unless you've hit murderous traffic or your airline was delayed which we totally understand.

Gary designed and built our home and developed our property. He also handcrafts functional wood art in his 2,000 square foot shop.  I handcraft all natural vegan skincare products in the soap kitchen Gary built for me. Our company is called Soap the Earth. Our motto is \"Happy Skin, Happy Animals and a Happy Planet\" \r\nI'm also a licensed esthetician and massage therapist. We have our small cottage spa, right here, where you can book treatments. \r\nWe love what we do and feel so lucky we get to spend the time together in these beautiful surroundings.\r\nAfter many years of health issues, we cleaned up our act and got rid of all household chemicals and became vegan, Gary's lagging behind a little bit in the vegan category :) \r\nIt's also what prompted me to create all natural skincare products.\r\nIn todays hectic way of life, we firmly believe all of us need moments of quiet solitude in natures beauty to reboot and reconnect with nature \r\nOur mission is to have you leave refreshed and replenished.",

Malibu's best surf beaches and most secluded beautiful beaches are just 2 miles down the road and in the other direction are wine-tasting sites in the midst of Malibu's vineyards.  And, don't forget to star-gaze here in one of LA's only Dark-Sky preserves.

The Grassy Knoll up by Vintage Market, which has fresh scooped Beachy Creme Ice Cream and is where the Malibu bus ends, is a favorite for local celebrities to try out their acts and has played host to many recently!  Casa Escobar, down by the Malibu pier,  is the stop for yummy TexMex and some higher end acts. Lucas Nelson was just there. They have fabulous egg dishes too! My favorite is a romantic spot looking over the ocean, Geoffrey's.  Plan to be there just before sunset so you can see the dolphins who are always swimming by!! Ask for a table along the rail so you have the best ocean views!! This is one of the most romantic spots in the world!",

It's a great way to kick off  a day in paradise! If you would like to host a dinner party, as long as you clean everything up and replace anything broken or missing, be my guest. The place is very well suited for it either in the fabulous dining room or on the lush garden patio. Emphasis on clean up after yourself and don't break anything or replace it if you do. This does need to be agreed to in advance.",

No one will enter unless you ask one of us to, unless we have to turn off water or lights left on, or if someone leaves and has forgotten to lock the private entrance and I am leaving. Also, we need a heads up as to your arrival time at least 48 hours in advance, if you will not be arriving at the stated 3 PM check in time, because we want to make sure to be respectful of your schedule and be available at the time needed. Failure to set up a time to get checked in with us in advance may result in your not having access at the time you want because we can't accommodate you if we don't know what you need.",

Next thing I knew, I fell in love with fixing up this house. So, now it is very cozy and clean.\r\n\r\nI work primarily as an attorney in digital technology area in the San Francisco Bay Area and come back home to Malibu on as many weekends as possible. My husband's boutique land use and environmental law firm is in Santa Monica. The fruit of his labor is evident when you drive up our canyon and see all the parkland. His litigation led to the preservation of this special place. (Angel Law)\r\n\r\nMore re: languages - My husband also speaks German, Luxembourgish, French and Spanish.",

Within reason you should find pretty everything you can think of for you here. If you don't, it can probably be arranged.\r\n\r\nI have been writing a guide \"what's interesting for me in Malibu\". It's now 30 pages long and it's yours to keep.  So far my guests seem to like it.\r\n\r\nYou'll find more on me on that famous \"book with faces\" if you search for \"heikki malibu\" -most likely I am the only one you find.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Malibu West is the real, authentic Malibu populated by the surfers, ranchers, and artists that together create a unique environment. While neighbors are hardly visible here in our canyon, a great way to enjoy the architecture of the area is to stroll along the shore of Broad Beach where many Malibu celebrities live.  Another great option is to cruise Mulholland Drive all the way to the ocean.",
        "notes": "It is important to note that during the months of Dec, Jan, Feb, & March, the temperature at night can fall below 50 degrees.  Although there is a nice wood pellet stove heater in the yurt, it is important to be aware that it can be chilly by morning even with the heater on, so we recommend having some warmer morning clothing available during these months.  We provide extra blankets for the bed during this time also.  The pool is available year-round but, of course, the water isn't warm until around July - October.  Note that the hot tub is not part of the AirBnB amenities.",
        "transit": "Having a car is best, but if you don't we can pick you up at the bus stop at Trancas down the road for a reasonable fee.  Please note that taxis charge between 95-150 for transport from LAX or downtown L.A.  Unless you are an intrepid trekker comfortable with city transport, you will definitely need a car.",
        "access": "Guests have access to the pool and pool patio in addition to their own private terrace. The pool area is technically a bonus area and not officially part of the Airbnb reservation, however, feel free to utilize the area along with other guests. Guests also have access to hiking trails right outside the door as 180 degrees of the property is bordered by Santa Monica Mountains Parks. Malibu's best surf beaches and most secluded beautiful beaches are just 2 miles down the road and in the other direction are wine-tasting sites in the midst of Malibu's vineyards. And, don't forget to star-gaze here in one of LA's only Dark-Sky preserves.",
        "interaction": "Lastly, guests have access to Malibu's most affordable, quality dining option - our own farm-to-table, all organic home-cooked breakfast or dinners. Check the Menu at the end of this section, however be aware please that meals are an Option not covered or part of the Airbnb reservation.

After spending the past 15 years in real estate development and representing vacation properties in Aspen, I decided to chase my dream to live near the water so built a fleet of Airstream travel trailers, which I rent to travelers seeking a West Coast adventure.  During my \"down\" time, I buy, sell and customize vintage Airstreams to be used for corporate events, romantic couples getaways, family vacations, extra guest lodging at your home or winery and just about anything else you can dream of.\r\n\r\nThe fleet consists of late model Airstreams.  With a proper tow vehicle and experience, we allow you to hitch up and take with you.  If you don't have a sufficient tow vehicle, we can help locate one through a rental company otherwise we have a network of drivers who can delivery/setup/pick up so you have a truly turn key glamping experience.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any additional questions as look forward to helping you plan your next adventure!\r\n\r\nGodspeed,\r\nChristopher",

Malibu is a large area-- 27 miles, with many remote canyons-- but we are centrally located and a quick 20 minutes from Santa Monica (without traffic). Guests can go to dinner at Nobu and be home in ten minutes. Our canyon isn't really a \"neighborhood\"-- no sidewalks or street lights. Lots of wide open space, very few neighbors and an enormous ocean view. The closest beaches are Carbon Beach, one mile away (look for signs on PCH indicating Public Beach Access) and Surfrider Beach (otherwise known as \"Malibu Beach\") two miles to the north.  Nature abounds here and the rural surroundings, privacy and spectacular ocean views provide a very laid back environment. The pool house is the perfect place to decompress and restore.",

Our home is our sanctuary and we appreciate knowing a little bit about who will be here. An inquiry without any information about the guests will not lead to a booking.

We communicate with guests via the Airbnb website-- please download the Airbnb app or check the website for messages. Uber and Lyft are not possible from our property. The pool house does not have a T.V. and cell phone service can be spotty or non-existent in most of Malibu, depending on your carrier. The Wifi in the pool house is strong.

It sleeps two people comfortably and unfortunately we cannot accommodate more than two people per night. The pool house is not suitable for parties.

Please, no pizza delivery men/visitors ringing our doorbell (or our neighbor's). This is a rural area and deliveries really don't work well.

We are also just a few homes away from The Saddle Peak Lodge, a critically-acclaimed restaurant known for its exotic wild game! Rock-climbing, biking trails, hiking trails all easy distance!",
        "notes": "From May-September is our high season and we are always booked to the teeth!! One night stays have become unfeasible for us, however we know most hosts do not offer one-night stays in the area and we LOVE our roadtrippers! So we have decided that in lieu of stopping single-night bookings all together we have simply added an additional 75-fee for those who would like to stay just one night. This helps a little to offset the cost of losing multi-night booking and to get outside help with cleaning! We have two large dogs and three small dogs and that call our property home (all rescues). They are very friendly. They do bark! But we will kennel them at night to keep the peace. We also have a number of horses! While we encourage you to visit the horses, we ask that you engage them with caution and ask that you always stay behind all fences. Please note that the property's beauty comes from its rural nature, which carries some hazards including rattle snakes! But not to worry, just stick to",

Feel free to explore the grounds and enjoy the pool as much as you like!! We recommend cooking on the bbq and eating by the pool or watching the sunset! While there is much to see and experience in the Santa Monica Mountains, this ranch is also very beautiful so staying in might be for you.",

We are willing to offer a refund less a 135 cancellation fee (approx 1 night stay) to those who need to cancel last minute. This does not include airbnb fees paid, of which we have no control.

Everyone enjoys the beauty of having coffee or tea in the morning out on the deck in the peace and serenity of the ranch. This is a great place to write, use as a base camp for recreation adventures, do yoga, plan local wine adventures, or just chill. The evenings are glorious, a star filled sky, a big moon, and nature all around. The neighborhood, if you could call it a neighborhood consists of homes scattered throughout the mountains. There are a couple homes on adjacent properties fairly close but you will feel like you are peacefully secluded and privately tucked away in your own mountain world.",

I have a small Weber charcoal BBQ that you can use by request only please.  Unfortunately the horses are not for public use as they are retired. They are rescues so please do not pet or feed them as they are not very friendly and may bite.",

I was born and raised in a wonderful small town in Texas and made my way to the Los Angeles area 29 years ago.  I can't believe it's been that long!  During that time I got married, opened a business with my husband, raised children and settled in Malibu where I've lived now for 16 years.  It's amazing that a lifetime can be summed up in a small paragraph.  :)\r\n\r\nI love movies, nature, gardening, animals, traveling, museums, people, visiting with friends, and mostly spending time with my family.  And I'm addicted to Mexican food which I could eat every day! \r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience I've had renting our house, meeting so many different people from all over the world, hearing their stories,  and especially seeing their smiling faces before and after they've stayed here.  It's such a great feeling, after all the years of serious hard work I've spent on the house and garden, knowing I've helped create a lovely memory for them.",

Plus, Nobu is about 4 miles up the road as is Malibu Farm, Cafe' Havana and several other notable restaurants.",

Otherwise, I can recommend several other great hiking trails on public land, the closest being Temescal Canyon about 5 miles away.",

This is actually what led me to become a host with Airbnb and I couldn't be happier that I made this decision to do so. I'm not so sure my friends are as happy about this as I am as La Maison is often booked. C'est la vie!\n\r\nI love the small town feel of Malibu and it's seclusion yet proximity to the city. Every chance I get I go hiking, stand up paddling or taking walks on the beach. While I still travel extensively, I couldn't think of a better place to call home.",

From these vacationers, I have a super collection of trinkets and items brought to me from their different cities and states. If you visit my home, I would be pleased if you would enjoy adding a trinket from your area to my wonderfully unique collection. I like small trinkets that have your city engraved on them, leaving a small part of you with me forever!!\r\n\r\nMy friends would describe me as committed loyal friend, a stellar and visionary businesswoman, and an elegant, gracious hostess \u2013For 30 years I have enjoyed entertaining my family and friends as I love to cook and host others. I have a wonderful collection of serving pieces and items for guests to use in my stocked kitchen.  I love to host birthday parties for each of my friends and just share some wine and celebrate the gift of life and share some laughter.  My motto, \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d is on a plaque that adorns my wall. (However, as YOUR host, I am NEVER at home during your visit, I prefer to offer you complete privacy!)\r\n\r\nAs your host I look forward to sharing my piece of paradise that overflows with blue and tranquil ocean views, where you will breathe fresh air, smell my wonderful flowers, and just live a luxurious lifestyle as one of my prized travelers. My home is named \u201cCasa de la Nueva Vida\u201d The house of new life!  It earned that name because all that enters my doors get a new outlook on life and a refreshed feeling as you will overlook a spectacular panoramic ocean view and hundreds of acres of rolling hills. National parkland is directly below my home, where you will be thrilled to hike the many trails and see the real beauty of nature just minutes from my home.\r\n\r\nI am in tuned to health & fitness, reading labels before purchasing or eat foods, visiting the gym or hiking the Malibu hills or strolling the beaches. I try to be a minimalist without clutter in my home, so I am described as very neat, organized, multi- tasker who manages to get 26 hours out of my day!\r\n\r\nIn California and Missouri, I am a licensed real estate broker and I operate and manage firms in both cities, which keep me traveling back and forth to service all of my various client needs. It gives me a great pleasure to specialize in marketing and selling the luxury living lifestyle in Malibu for the past 25 years. My greatest pleasure is to help buyers live their dream and sellers to sell to move on with their dreams.  Whether you are looking to lease temporarily or buy, I am ready to help you in Malibu with my team of Realtors at Seabreeze Estates Realty.\r\n\r\nMy Life motto is \"Delay is NOT Denial\" and I live a \"Life by Design\", I don't postpone, I am action oriented and I work hard at creating my own destiny.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "This unique Malibu hide-a-way is located down a private road off of the Mulholland Highway scenic route in West Malibu. Sweeping tree-lined vistas and oak-covered mountains are all around.  Every sunset is amazing! The Malibu Country Club, Calamigos Ranch & Conference Center, Malibu & Vine Tasting, the Cornell Winery Tasting Room, The Old Place (an old timey bar featured in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\"), Backbone Trail, Malibu Wine Safaris, Circle X Ranch, Leo Cabrillo Beach, the famous Rock Store, the equally famous Neptune's Net, and many local wineries are all near by. Plus is you go the other direction, into Westlake, you have Cisco Kid's, Sprouts, and Brent's Deli.",
        "notes": "This is a real ranch so occasionally the alpacas will mouth off with their weird vocalizations. Frequently, you can hear coyotes howling at night and owls hooting from the trees. There are bunnies, cute quail families, woodpeckers, hawks, lizards, toads, and others. The night sky is dark and amazingly dense with stars. People who live in the city really miss out on how many more stars you can see at night. This is a really great place if you like nature. You are close to options which include surfing, hiking, biking, wine-touring, archery, and art-viewing. Outside is rustic, inside has old world charm. If you want to get a sense of camping, but still want the comforts of a cozy home, this is the place. The house has a kitchen, a bedroom, a living room, and a bathroom with a shower, toilet, and sink (but no tub). The couches could sleep one adult and one child comfortably or two children (but note there is no bedroom door). The place is best suited for one person, a couple, or a family",

Coffee and tea available for mornings, as well as pancake or waffle options, if you choose to cook them. Netflix, Internet,  board games, books, lots of parking, small oven,  hot plates, waffle-maker, donut-maker, fridge, dishes and complete utensils for cooking, ceiling fan, room heater, felting lessons (if you would like), and lots of interesting and beautiful exterior spaces to explore. There is a view of the ocean in three places from the top of the property. There are also vintage dresses and art available for purchase from the gallery.",

This place is unique in Malibu as it refects the old style of Malibu living, seems almost like the South of France, except that you are less than 15 minutes from the California Coast and equally the same distance to Westlake. You might see bobcats, mountain lions, coyotes, owl, cool lizard and rabbits during your stay, but regardless you will ses a sky full of stars as we are far from city lights. This beautiful little magical cottage, seems out of time, but is still delighfully close to local vineyards, the beach, and the big city.",

We are one of the most private house in the neighborhood.  WILDLIFE/NATURE  This beautiful, diverse, and wild mountain is home to an amazing assortment of wildlife. This is THEIR home we are their neighbors on the edge of this wilderness. With that in mind, we try to maintain a no-kill philosophy on the property. The house is VERY clean, but you might see some lizards, ants, and other critters during your stay (particularly during the summer). If you enjoy hiking, there are many trails nearby, including the famous Backbone Trail which is only a few steps away. You will be surrounded by beautiful state and national parks.

You are welcome to verify this fact by calling Airbnb. This may sound odd but believe our previous experience for notting it, there are sometime some bad weather or other natural occurrences that can happened and if there is nothing in our power we can do about it, we are asking you kindly not to hold us responsible or negatively impact our review  when you leave one.

I love to hike and to explore less travelled paths. I collect rocks and work with metals. I love large open spaces and cherish solitude, the clarity it brings. I live on a beautiful piece of the Earth and like to share it with people of like minds...who care about beauty and the creative nature of people.",

Request day-light arrival. Prior arrival arrangement recommended. Check-in after 4PM.   Not all Map Apps are dependable in the mountains of Malibu.  Review driving directions, coordinates, and photos prior to booking.   Large exterior lights to be extinguished by 10 PM - to allow us all to enjoy the amazing star display in our dark (non-city) sky.  No commercial ventures.  Contact Site Manager, Rosalee Mayeux for bookings information:  (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN). Will consider small pets on an individual basis for 20/night. Feel free to inquire. Use of fireplaces requires pre-approval by host based on current Malibu weather &  local fire-conditions.",

I love where I live - Sage Hill Ranch is a 7 acre paradise overlooking the ocean. It used to be a Christmas tree farm & there are hundreds of enormous Pine trees on the property. I have 5 horses & the riding around here is amazing. Miles of ocean view trails - the Backbone trail goes all the way to the beach. I planted a vineyard when I moved here 6 years ago & now we are enjoying our own Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon & Sauvignon Blanc which we are happy to share with cabin guests! I have loved having Airbnb guests staying in the cabin. Everyone that has stayed has been so nice & many have become friends. I look forward to experiencing other Airbnb accommodations on my travels to Europe.",

Its not unusual on a Sunday afternoon to see a group of friends enjoying wine and music while watching the beautiful Pacific ocean.  \r\n\r\nI've put a lot of love and care into my music, my food and my home.  Ask me about doing a lunch or dinner for you while you are here!  I'm happy to chef for you while you enjoy the house.  \r\n\r\nI am also fluent in German, Italian and English and welcome international guests. \r\n\r\nowner living on premesis always ready\r\nTo assist you",

Horse back riding, hiking and mountain biking.  Freeway also 7 mins away if visiting other areas of LA.  Great shopping! Since we are located in the Malibu Wine Trail it would be a good idea to visit some of the vineyards and sample their wines i.e. WINE TASTING!! 1.  Malibu Wines is across the street however you should go to their wine tasting bar located at 31740 Mullholland HWY approx 2 mins drive from the house, easily walkable.  They also have the Malibu wines Safari call (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN).  Cielo Wines is my neighbor behind the house.  You have to belong to their private club to go to the Barn, however, they make exceptions for my guests. Please let me know when booking if you'd like to go wine tasting there as they will need to know in advance. 3. Malibu Rocky Oaks Estate Vineyard located at 340 Kanan RD Malibu a",

        "house_rules": "1.  There will be a separate charge for propane usage to heat the pool and jacuzzi.  Upon arrival you'll be asked to sign a document which allows the propane company to charge your credit card directly for your usage.  I will send you a reading of your usage daily so you have an idea of the costs.    2.  We are on a septic system which is very delicate, do not put anything down the toilets but human waste.   3.  Do not put anything down the garbage disposal, put all food scraps into the garbage.   4.  Only use natural biodegradable products for your hair skin etc as anything other than that will ruin the septic system.   5.  Do not leave french doors open unattended as you will have unwanted guests i.e. rodents, (we are in the middle of the wine trail)   6.  Please do not leave the heating and air on if you are not in the house or if the doors are left open.   7.  All doors should be locked prior to leaving the house for any length of time.   8.

After spending the past 15 years in real estate development and representing vacation properties in Aspen, I decided to chase my dream to live near the water so built a fleet of Airstream travel trailers, which I rent to travelers seeking a West Coast adventure.  During my \"down\" time, I buy, sell and customize vintage Airstreams to be used for corporate events, romantic couples getaways, family vacations, extra guest lodging at your home or winery and just about anything else you can dream of.\r\n\r\nThe fleet consists of late model Airstreams.  With a proper tow vehicle and experience, we allow you to hitch up and take with you.  If you don't have a sufficient tow vehicle, we can help locate one through a rental company otherwise we have a network of drivers who can delivery/setup/pick up so you have a truly turn key glamping experience.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any additional questions as look forward to helping you plan your next adventure!\r\n\r\nGodspeed,\r\nChristopher",

My video is unembellished. My booking process is dunce level simple. My follow up is compulsive every step of the way. I'm always accessible by phone, text or email. I provide a comprehensive printout for arrival. I've labeled light switches, fans, heaters and remote controls. I oversee cleaning. I oversee every turnover. I make certain everything is re-stocked, fully equipped and working. I refund security deposits promptly and make certain they clear. And I offer a 'repeat offender' discount for returning vacationers. My insight? It must be working because 25% of my vacationers are 'repeat offenders.'",

Over the past 15 years I've restored several vintage Airstream trailers and consider them the ultimate in camping comfort. One of my restorations now actually resides in Japan! \r\nWe used to love to travel and camp in our 1957 'FLYING CLOUD' AIRSTREAM but now enjoy allowing others to share the experience without the hassle of driving, towing and fighting for a spot in a crowded and noisy campground. We live on a 40+ acre ranch property (with some overly friendly dogs and horses) in the Santa Monica Mountains- surrounded by thousands of acres of open space and direct access to the famous Backbone Trail, which is renowned for hiking, horseback and mountain bike riding. We are also only 6 miles from the glorious beaches of Malibu. Our hilltop location is the perfect deluxe camping experience, with ocean views, and base to enjoy this unique mountain range and Mediterranean climate which occurs in only 6 places in the world.",

Malibu has world class dining, shopping, art galleries and we are next door to Pepperdine. There is a gas station and a mini mart at the bottom of our street. The beach is 9 minutes away. We are in the Malibu wine tasting  zone and we can suggest tasting rooms and wine tours plus of course we have many family friendly cafes and coffee shops. Ask Geraldine for suggestions and she will steer you well. There is the Getty Villa, iconic Malibu Pier, Point Dume and Zuma beach for frolicking in the surf or walk along the sand.",
        "notes": "This travel trailer is very comfortable but small and cozy. Best for a couple with 1-2 children. It is very tight for 4 adults but it has been done before. Convenient meals or use of the microwave is prefect. The kitchen is too small for gourmet cooking. The shower and bathroom are very small (think airplane sized) but the water is hot and plentiful. Great spot for a home base after a day at the beach, wine tastings etc, and at the fraction of the cost of a hotel. We also have a guest house and two private suites on the property available through Airbnb but at a much higher price. Just to give you an idea the RV park close by charges 130 plus plus per night and you have to bring your own RV. If you are the type of person who is \"allergic\" to wildlife or used to staying at the Ritz Carlton, this is not the place for you. Our neighborhood is home to deer, raccoons, foxes, rabbits, hawks, coyotes, hummingbirds, crickets, butterflies, and other critters.",
        "transit": "You will need a car to get around Malibu.Its so rural that public transportation doesn't really apply. Just another note we had a recent guest who thought that she was renting a trailer to drive around in and of course this is not the case.",

You do not need to get into your car to go hiking as we are on 250 acres of pristine land. There is a picnic area. Feel free to walk around the hiking trails on the property.",
        "interaction": "Your interaction with our family will be limited as we are all very busy. Our property manager lives in the RV next to the travel trailer. He is very quiet and private. That said we are very friendly and welcome a friendly chat over coffee or a glass of wine. We do not smoke and since we are in a high fire zone we do not allow smoking. Geraldine owns several restaurants so please feel free to ask about dining and wine tasting attractions and activities. Two property managers are usually around to help out and answer questions.",
        "house_rules": "I am delighted you have chosen to visit, whether it's business or vacation, I want you to enjoy your visit and the beautiful 250 acre property.  I have a few reqhttps://www.airbnb.com/helpuests and a few suggestions to make your stay the best it can possibly be.  First and very important is check in. Once I send you the directions please actually read them before you get into your car because the Corral Canyon part of your drive does not work too well with GPS or WAZE. And I promise you will get lost.  Another consideration is that once we agree on an arrival window of time to please honor that as this is not the kind of Estate where we can leave out a key in a lockbox.  We need to check you in personally, so if we agree you're arriving between 4 and 5 pm can you please do that unless you've hit murderous traffic or your airline was delayed which we totally understand.

I prefer dishes in the dishwasher, wet towels in the laundry room, and the floors broom swept. Furniture should be in precise spots as before arrival, and ideally not be moved at all. Neighbors complain about loud talking or music on the balconies after 10 pm; if you are out after that, speak softly. cheers, John",

My husband is from Italy so family, friends, good food, and travel is important to us. We just finished remodeling the house and love the way it came out. Our home is important to us. We rented our house out only once before, before the remodel and had a very positive experience. Looking forward to another chance to share our home with other great people.",

While the canyon provides a rural escape, access to boho chic Malibu juice bars, coffee houses, restaurants and shops is a 1/2 mile walk away. Cross Creek and Malibu Lumber Yard shopping/dining areas are a 10 minute drive down the coast. Zuma Beach or Paradise Cove is a 3/4 mile walk or bike ride from the property. And Point Dume is located just across the highway - perfect for exploring by bike. Hikers, runners and nature lovers will be in heaven with access to the Santa Monica Mountain trails just steps from the property.",

Sometimes coyotes can be heard at night, however the guesthouse has double paned windows to ensure uninterrupted slumber.

We offer the perfect family location for college tours or graduation celebrations.",

The host can always be reached via text message should questions arise.",
        "house_rules": "The guesthouse is like new, appointed with a combination of collectable mid-century modern and new furnishings, including all new sheets, towels, kitchenware and the like. We ask that guests remove their shoes upon entering the house to maintain cleanliness. This is a no-smoking property. Guests are not permitted to  smoke in or near the guesthouse + studio or anywhere on the property as Malibu is susceptible to fires, particularly in the dry months. Because the property has many animals including horses, pigs, goats, chickens and dogs, no visiting pets are allowed. While the guesthouse has its own brand new septic system, please refrain from throwing anything in the toilet except for what naturally comes out of your body + toilet tissue. Septic systems are sensitive. Late check out requests must be made 24 hours in advance of departure date and approved by host. An additional 50 fee will be charged.",

Having lived in Malibu for more than 20 years I have deep knowledge of and can recommend beautiful equestrian and mountain bike trails as well as some of the best and/or most challenging hikes in the Santa Monica Mountains.   \r\n\r\nIt would be my pleasure to introduce you to the benefits of nature and what this community has to offer.\r\n\r\nI have three gated horses - two Rocky Mountains and one Missouri Fox Trotter, all with excellent credentials work & knowledge of the Santa Monica Mountains.  For experienced riders, feel free to contact me if you are interested in working out an add-on riding experienced overlooking the Pacific of exploring the largest urban park in the US ... just out of your back door!\r\n\r\nYour first evening welcomes you with a bottle of fine wine from one of Malibu's local wineries. Should you want to tour the wineries and experience an afternoon of wine tasting, they're but minutes away.\r\n\r\nA barbecue on a lovely outdoor private patio is yours to use while you are a guest here at the 'Angels of the Oaks'. We are in a California Shenandoah Oak Preserve surrounded by national and state parks. Caution with sparks required.\r\n\r\nShould you be interested in being pampered, massage therapists, aestheticians, yoga instructors are only minutes away. \r\n\r\nI would be very happy to make the arrangements for you.\r\n\r\nFor those evenings that you simply want to cozy up and enjoy the movies or a premium series, Netflix is available for you to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI look forward to welcoming you to what guests have said is a magical, energizing, and beautiful place to call home for as many days as you choose to stay.",

I personally feel there is nothing better than to wake up here in the morning to a rooster call, to open the windows and smell the scent of wild lands, although this area looks a lot like Amalfi Coast, I have not experienced this amazing scent anywhere, its kind of a mixture of wild flowers and something clean and fresh, vergine, i imagine this part of the world smelling exactly like this when we were not species we are now. At night millions of bright stars and sounds of crickets, frogs and wildlife keep you entertained, should you chose a peaceful informal dinner on the patio, after watching the sunset, and then again, there are lovely Continental, Italian, Japanese, and fusion restaurants around to cater to vast variety of taste,",

It's now 30 pages long and it's yours to keep.  So far my guests seem to like it.\r\n\r\nYou'll find more on me on that famous \"book with faces\" if you search for \"heikki malibu\" -most likely I am the only one you find.",

        "host_about": "Welcome to our Airbnb profile!  We are Sean & Sanne from DreamHaus.\r\n DreamHaus is a boutique vacation rental and lifestyle company based in Los Angeles, California. How many times have you gone on vacation and ended up doing exactly what everyone else does? You ate at the same restaurants, shopped at the same stores, and went to the same beaches as everyone else. Sure- it was fun and all but you probably went home wondering what else there was to see and do. Where are the private beaches? Where do the locals hang out? The friendly faces at DreamHaus are here to tell you. The concept was hatched when two former colleagues at a large, luxury vacation rental company noticed something was missing- that personal touch. Sean Greiner and Sanne Hamers quickly bonded over their common vision and created something a little different. They wanted to offer homeowners and guests alike a friendly, dependable, welcoming way to experience vacation rentals. They created DreamHaus to connect gorgeous, unique, upscale homes across L.A. with those who wish to visit them. Sean and Sanne are Los Angeles locals themselves and know all of best things to do and see. Attention to detail is their specialty- you can expect personalized communication before and during your stay to ensure your vacation is fantastic. L.A. is a big city with a lot to do- so having a friendly local host will ensure you experience the scene like a true local.",

I was born and raised in a wonderful small town in Texas and made my way to the Los Angeles area 29 years ago.  I can't believe it's been that long!  During that time I got married, opened a business with my husband, raised children and settled in Malibu where I've lived now for 16 years.  It's amazing that a lifetime can be summed up in a small paragraph.  :)\r\n\r\nI love movies, nature, gardening, animals, traveling, museums, people, visiting with friends, and mostly spending time with my family.  And I'm addicted to Mexican food which I could eat every day! \r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience I've had renting our house, meeting so many different people from all over the world, hearing their stories,  and especially seeing their smiling faces before and after they've stayed here.  It's such a great feeling, after all the years of serious hard work I've spent on the house and garden, knowing I've helped create a lovely memory for them.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Our neighborhood is quiet and tranquil, yet only minutes to the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. We have a lovely hike right at the beginning of our property, and a 1255 acre park only two minutes drive up the hill. Both of these hikes see little people or traffic and give you a sense of how Malibu would have been before 1850. You will hear the sea from the barn and many times Whales, Seals and dolphins can be spotted. If you love nature, this is the place for you!",
        "notes": "We are happy to have children on the property, but we must inform you that as the space is on a hillside, there are areas that may not be safe for children. Although we are close to Santa Monica and Malibu town, our area feels secluded and away from it all. This is perfect in every way except one - cell phone reception! Unfortunately it is spotty in this area. If you can use web based communication - (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)/ (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it is better.",
        "transit": "We are four minutes uphill from the Pacific Coast Highway. You will have the most freedom if you bring a car. We have two parking spaces available for the guests. There are so many things to do on the 17 miles of coastline of Malibu, you will want to have a car to go everywhere. From our pristine public beaches, surfing, boogie-boarding, wind and kite sailing, paddle-boarding and laying out on the clean white sand, Malibu boasts 5-star eating establishments and great high-end shopping opportunities. Amazing options for hiking trails (one right next to the barn) and parks. There are public buses that travel up and down the Pacific Coast Highway, taxi services are available by telephone, and Uber.",

You will be shown through the barn and made familiar with how it all works, as well as the garden areas at your disposal. Even though we are close to each other we won't disturb your visit unless there is anything you need.",
        "house_rules": "Malibu is in the middle of an historic drought and Fires are a real danger Therefore Smoking is strictly prohibited on the property. There are steps behind the barn that lead up to a vista. Some of them are loose. We ask that you not walk up the steps as we cannot take responsibility for your safety. Our neighborhood is quiet and tranquil. For this reason we do not allow large groups of people, or parties on the property, due to limited parking space extra guests are not allowed.",

My host property hovers above the ocean vistas in a classic chaparral/canyon setting. We are members of a small and tight knit neighborhood of single family dwellings, seven minutes from the main traffic artery, Pacific Coast Highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile vacationing at our peacefully engaging cabin and gardens you may want to visit \"Leather Waves\", my on site custom leather working  studio where you can see me creating my globally coveted one of a kind leather goods, specializing in clothing and accessories of renown style and elegance.\r\n\r\nYou will be viewing my beautiful printed photography and original artworks used to decorate the cabin, capturing some of Malibu's most intriguing landscapes, the surf culture, and our native plant and wildlife. In fact you might like to book a session with me to be photographed right here on the property or in one of Malibu's famous locations.\r\n\r\nI'm a \"devoted lover\" of Malibu, my chosen home for life, and I will share as much of my knowledge, memories and recommendations as you wish to know. I love good fresh and heathy food, I grow many things in my extensive gardens which I will be excited to share with you in the appropriate season. I'm inspired by beautiful sunsets and clean ocean waves. I'm passionate about peacefully quiet environments filled with singing birds, expansive cloudscapes, and fresh air. Being a lifelong practitioner of Yoga you will find my rental to be an extension of my calm and serene attitudes about a compassionate and caring lifestyle. \r\n\r\nLike many a traveler I value a great meal at the local bistro, a cozy elegant bedroom where I can spend special romantic moments with my loved one, sitting comfortably outdoors feeling an unexpected breeze while sipping a glass of wine and hearing the birdsong of many a wildlife visitor or cozying-up at the fireplace and watching my favorite movies.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you and making your stay at the \"Robbins Nest Retreat\" one of your cherished memories.",

I was born and raised in a wonderful small town in Texas and made my way to the Los Angeles area 29 years ago.  I can't believe it's been that long!  During that time I got married, opened a business with my husband, raised children and settled in Malibu where I've lived now for 16 years.  It's amazing that a lifetime can be summed up in a small paragraph.  :)\r\n\r\nI love movies, nature, gardening, animals, traveling, museums, people, visiting with friends, and mostly spending time with my family.  And I'm addicted to Mexican food which I could eat every day! \r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience I've had renting our house, meeting so many different people from all over the world, hearing their stories,  and especially seeing their smiling faces before and after they've stayed here.  It's such a great feeling, after all the years of serious hard work I've spent on the house and garden, knowing I've helped create a lovely memory for them.",

We are what most people would consider \"remote.\"  Our nearest neighbor is about 800 feet away and the road, although paved,  is winding and does not have street lights.  However, we are only a 15-20 mins by car to the beach, restaurants, movies, and only 10 mins to the Malibu Wine Country, and adjacent to the trails of the Santa Monica Mountains.  During the right season, you will see citrus and roses outside your door, and maybe even hummingbirds or an oriole or two.  The crows may wake you in the morning, and if you are lucky you will see our resident fox or bobcat at night.  At the right time of year, you will also hear the owls.  We built the house almost 40 years ago, and have lived here ever since, as have the owls.  This is not a new property nor are  we \"glamorous\" but this is life in the Malibu Mountains.  We are very comfortable here and we think you will be too.  We hope you enjoy your",

Please bring other drinks you may wish to have, as well as breakfast items or snacks with you because we do not have stores nearby, however, no matter how you get here, you pass grocery stores, so do pick up supplies.  Any additional items, if requested at least 48 hours prior to arrival, can be arranged at a surcharge.  There are dishes, glasses, and other utensils in the kitchenette.  Shampoo, hair dryer, soap, and other essentials usually supplied in a hotel, are provided.  Hangers are in the closet.  Cleaning service and renewal of linens is provided once a week, unless requested more often, at an additional charge.  If you wish to do bird watching or star gazing, please bring your own binoculars and/or telescope.  We are not suitable for pets or small children, and only allow a maximum of 2 people in the room.

Part of the joy of being here is the solitude and the remoteness of the mountains, the peace, serenity, and privacy that comes with the place.  If you have an emergency, we will be available but other than that, we want you to enjoy the natural surroundings, although civilization is just a hop, skip, and a jump away, as is the glamour of Malibu and its beaches.

You may hike, bike, surf, swim, boogie board, go wine tasting, and visit Pepperdine University all within 10-15 minutes. There is also a beautiful creek walk along the property.",
        "notes": "Unique characteristics to the area:  California is in drought and ask that you are considerate of all resources especially water.  There is off street parking available. ALL of Malibu is on a septic system and requires your cooperation.  There is \"on site\" laundry for emergencies and extended bookings. Please note it is very quiet in the neighborhood. Our \"white noise\" is owls, coyotes, and bobcats and when there is water in the stream, frogs!   We appreciate your keeping it that way.  Thank you.",

Approximately 3 miles from PCH. Uber is available in the area, which is recommended if you are going wine tasting.  Please select Uber drivers that are familiar with the area and also read and speak fluent English.  The canyons are not for someone that is \"already lost or unfamiliar with the area,\" particularly after dusk.    While we are only 3 miles off PCH, it is a world apart!  Rural - ie, few street lights, no sidewalks, windy canyon.  Please select  your driver carefully and provide him with the detail directions to get here successfully.  We are only 3 turns and only 3 miles off of PCH, but it can feel disorienting with canyon roads, especially after sunset.  Thank you.",
        "access": "You have your own private access to the suite with your own set of keys. You will take a flight of stairs down from the main street to the entrance of the suite. There are lights that serve to guide your steps if you arrive past sunset. Malibu lights operate from dusk to dawn.  You have complete access to the perimeters of your suite and adjacent outdoor barbecue patio.  I request that you please respect the personal boundaries of the two lower floors of the main residence where I reside.  Please understand, you are ALWAYS encourage to contact me by phone, text or simply ringing the front doorbell.",
        "interaction": "I honor your space & time during your stay in the Cloud Suite. If you need recommendations I am available and open to helping you.  As an equestrian, I also can provide guided horseback trail rides through the private park trails adjacent to my property (additional cost to your stay).  Experienced riders only please.  Additionally, if you would enjoy a massage therapist and esthetician, yoga instructor or coach to visit, I can arrange that for you.",
        "house_rules": "No parties or loud music -  this is a quiet retreat space. Please be respectful of your noise levels and footprint.  Large exterior lights are extinguished by 10 PM to allow us all to enjoy the  amazing star display in our black (non-city) sky.   No smoking of any kind, as Malibu has fallen victim to fires in her past.  Will consider small pets on an individual basis for 20/night.  Feel free to inquire. Film shoot inquires should be directed to the Site Manager to arrange for shoots on the grounds.  Contact Host to arrange for bookings.   This property is not appropriate for running commercial ventures that involve client visits.",

I love where I live - Sage Hill Ranch is a 7 acre paradise overlooking the ocean. It used to be a Christmas tree farm & there are hundreds of enormous Pine trees on the property. I have 5 horses & the riding around here is amazing. Miles of ocean view trails - the Backbone trail goes all the way to the beach. I planted a vineyard when I moved here 6 years ago & now we are enjoying our own Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon & Sauvignon Blanc which we are happy to share with cabin guests! I have loved having Airbnb guests staying in the cabin. Everyone that has stayed has been so nice & many have become friends. I look forward to experiencing other Airbnb accommodations on my travels to Europe.",

I plan to travel to Africa in the summer and look forward to having guests stay at the house while I am gone. \r\nI will not be here while guests visit, I will take the opportunity to bring my two dogs, a stubborn dachshund and a lovely blue nose pit to the beaches of Santa Barbara for a quick get away. You will enjoy privacy and the use of the entire house and grounds. The horses, Cinnamon and Neptune, a cute mini, stay on the property while I am gone. My gardener will be in charge of feeding them, but you are welcome to interact with them. They love apples, carrots and any fresh greens! :)",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Malibu is a beautiful town with several different neighborhoods (many of which we have lived in).  We love our current neighborhood because of it's \"Real Malibu\" feel, horses, hiking and greenery as well as the proximity to Zuma & Westward & Broad Beach. There is also a great organic grocery store 1 mile away called Vintage Grocers. Our part of Malibu is less busy than the more commercialized parts of Malibu, but still just a 10 minute drive away. In the evening you will hear little (if not zero) traffic and only the crashing of the waves at Zuma. There are spectacular hiking & mountain biking trails a 2 minute drive behind the house as well as a great running/walking/bike path along the beach.  If you choose to dine out we can give you a list of great restaurants in the area based on your preferences.",
        "notes": "We will only consider guests with previous positive reviews, and the person booking MUST be the person staying at the house, no exceptions. Privacy and confidentiality are very important to us. We are a very neat and tidy household, and the house has recently been remodeled.  We ask our guests to please be mindful of this and to please respect the home as you would your own and leave it in the same condition as you found it. Please let us know in the case of any damage caused as soon as possible so we can work out a solution.   While this house does have 4 bedrooms, it is best enjoyed by families or groups of 4-6 people, and we have implemented different price tiers accordingly for the number of guests staying after 2 people.  Also, as with most of Malibu, we are on a septic system.  For this reason we cannot accommodate more than 6 guests per booking. The pool will be set to 86 degrees for the duration of your stay and the Jacuzzi to 101 (we will show you how to turn it on).  If you r",
        "transit": "As with most of Los Angeles, a car is highly recommended. Ubers & Lyfts are relatively easy to call and take between 5-20 minutes to arrive. Walking to the beach is a breeze, and there is a convenient crosswalk located right down the street so you don't have to worry about crossing Pacific Coast Highway to get to the beach. Santa Monica is about a 40 minute drive without traffic, and LA about an hour depending on the time  of day you leave.",
        "access": "Guests will have access to most of the house and all of the exterior.  There are 2 master bedroom walk-in closets, one of which we will keep locked as the owner's closet. Guests will not have access to the garage (stays of 1-month or more will), but there is parking for at least 6 cars inside the driveway gates. The pantry closet inside the laundry room will also be locked, but the laundry room itself is totally accessible and quite large with a giant sink and lots of counter space.",
        "interaction": "One of us should be able to greet you upon arrival and departure. If not, we will have a friend or relative with an intimate knowledge of the house to show you \"the ropes\". We will also be accessible by phone or email (or quite possibly in person) throughout your stay.",
        "house_rules": "- Please contact us with the details of your stay prior using instant book.  As per instant book guidelines if a guest does not abide by our house rules we have the right to cancel the booking. We cannot accommodate stays with more than 6 people. - Absolutely NO PARTIES and NO SMOKING! Non-booked guests are not allowed in the house without prior approval from one of us.  There is a security camera monitoring the outside the gates, as well as the street so please follow the rules. - No sand or chlorine in the house or on the furniture.   There is a pool bath that includes a shower and we request that you wash and dry off after exiting the pool or come home from the beach.  -Please respect the home as you would your own home and leave it in the same condition as you found it. - While we love children, the house may not be suitable for yours. Please email us to discuss if you plan to travel with children under 6.",

Lovely Hot tub to relax in - It is adjacent to the path to the other airbnb rental but i didn't want to make a privacy wall  because the Oak trees are so gorgeous and the other rental cannot see you once at their space. But I am looking forward to suggestions. Hammock, swings, nature walks, hiking, yoga, There is so much to do on this property. You share this property with wildlife and possibly another couple. We appreciate your respect to the land by  helping to keep the place wonderful for everyone.",

We are situated right in the middle of everything Malibu has to offer. No long winding drives. From Reel Kick Ranch, the beach is 1/2 mile drive or a 15 min walk to Latigo shores. World renown '1st point' Malibu pier beach is a ten minute drive and Zuma beach is a 15 min drive. We are between Solstice canyon and Escondido canyon parks and many others are only a short drive away! Latigo canyon road is also a famous motorcycle, road bike and driving canyon road. Be safe!",
